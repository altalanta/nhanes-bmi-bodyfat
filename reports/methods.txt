NHANES 2017-2018 BMI vs % Body Fat Analysis Methods
==================================================

Data Source:
- Cycles: 2017-2018 only
- Files: DEMO_J.XPT, BMX_J.XPT, DXX_J.XPT, DXXAG_J.XPT

Sample:
- Target population: U.S. civilian non-institutionalized adults (20-59 years)
- Inclusion: Valid BMI, DXA % body fat, and survey design variables
- Final sample size: 2240 participants
- Exclusions: 1179 due to missing data

Variables:
- BMI: BMXBMI from BMX_J (kg/m²)
- Whole-body % body fat: DXDTOFAT from DXX_J
- BMI classes: <18.5, [18.5,25), [25,30), [30,35), [35,40), ≥40 kg/m²

Survey Design:
- Weights: WTMEC2YR (2-year MEC examination weights)
- Strata: SDMVSTRA
- Primary sampling units: SDMVPSU
- Variance estimation: Taylor linearization
- Lonely PSU adjustment: applied

Statistical Methods:
- All estimates are survey-weighted with design-based standard errors
- Correlations computed from survey-weighted covariance matrix
- 95% confidence intervals use design-based standard errors
- Quantiles computed using survey methods

Missing Data:
- Complete-case analysis (listwise deletion)
- No multiple imputation applied
- DXA coverage in 2017-2018 cycle is generally good

Software:
- R version: R version 4.2.3 (2023-03-15)
- survey package version: 4.4.2
- dplyr package version: 1.1.4

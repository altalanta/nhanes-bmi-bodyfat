# NHANES 2017-2018 BMI vs Body Fat Analysis

Analysis of the association between Body Mass Index (BMI) and whole-body percent body fat using NHANES 2017-2018 data for U.S. civilian non-institutionalized adults aged 20-59 years.

## Overview

This analysis uses design-based (survey-weighted) statistical methods to estimate:

- Survey-weighted Pearson correlations between BMI and DXA-measured % body fat
- Mean % body fat by BMI class and sex with 95% confidence intervals
- Distribution of % body fat (5th, 50th, 95th percentiles) by BMI class and sex
- Assessment of linearity between BMI and % body fat

All estimates account for NHANES complex sampling design using MEC examination weights (WTMEC2YR), stratification (SDMVSTRA), and primary sampling units (SDMVPSU) with Taylor linearization for variance estimation.

## Key Results

- **Overall BMI-body fat correlation**: 0.914 (95% CI: 0.885-0.943)
- **Male correlation**: 0.917 (95% CI: 0.885-0.949)  
- **Female correlation**: 0.954 (95% CI: 0.941-0.967)
- **Sample size**: 2,240 adults with complete data
- **Significant non-linearity detected** (BMIÂ² term p = 0.007)

## Reproduction

### Data Requirements

Raw NHANES 2017-2018 data files (not included in this repository):
